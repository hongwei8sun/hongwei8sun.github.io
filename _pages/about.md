Sun Group focuses on developing and applying multiscale modeling methods to study atmospheric and climate science. The main research interests include: (1) Large-scale stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosol processes; (2) Small-scale aerosol–cloud interactions within the marine boundary layer; (3) The application of (1) and (2) to climate intervention (geoengineering). More details can be found on the [Research](https://hongwei8sun.github.io/research/) page. Feel free to contact the group PI (Dr. Hongwei Sun) at: *hongwei8@hawaii.edu*. <br />
