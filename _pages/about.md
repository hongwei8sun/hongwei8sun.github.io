I am a PhD candidate at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I currently works on solar geoengineering research. I am broadly interested in climate research and numerical modeling. In the past, I studied the climatic impacts of wind farms using numerical models. Prior to Harvard, I earned an M.S. from Tsinghua University in Atmospheric Sciences, and B.S./B.A. from Sun Yat-Sen University in Atmospheric Sciences.
