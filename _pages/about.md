Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, UW. Before the postdoc, I got my PhD from Harvard University in 2023. My main research interests are using multiscale modeling methods to study climate science, including: (1) larger-scale stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosol processes, (2) small-scale aerosol-cloud interactions in the marine boundary layer, and (3) their applications in climate engineering (geoengineering).
