Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc working with [Dr. Robert Wood](https://atmos.uw.edu/faculty-and-research/core-faculty/robert-wood/) and [Dr. Peter Blossey](https://atmos.uw.edu/faculty-and-research/core-faculty/peter-blossey/) at the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences, UW](https://atmos.uw.edu/faculty-and-research/postdoctoral-researchers/). Before the postdoc, I got my PhD from Harvard University in 2023, working with [Dr. David Keith](https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/people/david-keith) (PhD advisor) and [Dr. Sebastian Eastham](https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/eastham-sebastian). <br />

**I will join the [University of Hawaii](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/atmo/index.php/2023/10/31/oceanography-atmospheric-sciences-more-highly-ranked-for-program-excellence/) as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in Climate Science in 2025.**  <br />

My main research interests are developing and applying multiscale modeling methods to study atmospheric and climate science. More details can be found on my [research page](https://hongwei8sun.github.io/research/).

Check our [new paper](www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00664-8) in npj climate and atmospheric science! The paper is about stratospheric transport and dynamics, where we: <br />
**(1)** *Quantify the particle transport (e.g., particle number, lifetime, flux, tropospheric sinks) in the stratosphere.* <br />
**(2)** *Explore the physical drivers (e.g., QBO, tropopause folding) influencing the stratospheric transport.* <br />
