Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, UW. Before the postdoc, I got my PhD from Harvard University in 2023. My main research interests are using multiscale modeling methods to study climate science, including: (1) larger-scale stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosol processes, (2) small-scale aerosol-cloud interactions in the marine boundary layer, and (3) their applications in climate engineering (geoengineering). <br />

Check our new paper in npj climate and atmospheric science (www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00664-8)! The paper is about stratospheric transport and dynamics, where we: <br />
(1) Quantify the particle transport (e.g., particle number, lifetime, flux) in the stratosphere. <br />
(2) Explore the physical drivers (e.g., QBO, tropopause folding) influencing the stratospheric transport. <br />
