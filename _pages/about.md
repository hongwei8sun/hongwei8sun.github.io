Welcome to my website! <br />

I am a postdoc working with [Dr. Robert Wood](https://atmos.uw.edu/faculty-and-research/core-faculty/robert-wood/) and [Dr. Peter Blossey](https://atmos.uw.edu/faculty-and-research/core-faculty/peter-blossey/) at the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences, UW](https://atmos.uw.edu/faculty-and-research/postdoctoral-researchers/). Before the postdoc, I got my [PhD](https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/people/hongwei-sun) from Harvard University in 2023. <br />

My main research interests are developing and applying multiscale modeling methods to study climate science, including: (1) larger-scale stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosol processes, (2) small-scale aerosol-cloud interactions in the marine boundary layer, and (3) their applications in climate engineering (geoengineering). <br />

Check our [new paper](www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00664-8) in npj climate and atmospheric science! The paper is about stratospheric transport and dynamics, where we: <br />
(1) Quantify the particle transport (e.g., particle number, lifetime, flux) in the stratosphere. <br />
(2) Explore the physical drivers (e.g., QBO, tropopause folding) influencing the stratospheric transport. <br />
