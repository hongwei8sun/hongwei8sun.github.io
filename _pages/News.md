Happy to share that we have received new funding! <br />

I am honored to contribute to the solar radiation management (SRM) [project](https://climateengineering.uchicago.edu/news/csei-receives-5-million-grant-from-quadrature-climate-foundation-to-advance-srm-research/) led by the University of Chicago.  <br />

University of Hawaii will work on the second workstream: "*Reducing uncertainty surrounding how aerosol particles form in the wake of aircraft. This workstream will use multiscale modeling and advanced parameterization to better understand the size distribution and behavior of aerosols immediately after being released.*" <br />


## 04/24/2025
Attending the [2025 Solar Radiation Management Annual Meeting](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/event/solar-radiation-management-annual-meeting-2025/) hosted by the Simons Foundation. <br />
I am contributing to the project "*Modeling Atmospheric Turbulence and its Impacts on Plume Dispersion for Stratospheric Aerosol Injection*", led by Dr. Robert Wood (University of Washington).


## 04/14/2025
I am excited to join the Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB) workshop hosted by the Wood Group (University of Washington) in Leavenworth, WA. I will lead two sessions. <br />

**SESSION 3 (“thinking outside the box”):**  <br />
What new approaches could be used for improved assessment of MCB efficacy and detectability (e.g. machine learning, emulators, perturb-parameter ensembles)? <br />

**SESSION 5 (“aerosol, cloud and climate changes: oh my!”):**  <br />
How do cloud feedbacks with climate warming modulate the efficacy of MCB? How will changes in inadvertent anthropogenic aerosol emissions & changes in natural emissions with future climate modulate the future efficacy of MCB? <br />


## 02/20/2025
I will give a [talk](https://www.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1250/2632.htm) at the Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University. <br />

Check our [new paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00664-8) in npj climate and atmospheric science! The paper is about stratospheric transport and dynamics, where we: <br />
**(1)** *Quantify the particle transport (e.g., particle number, lifetime, flux, tropospheric sinks) in the stratosphere.* <br />
**(2)** *Explore the physical drivers (e.g., QBO, tropopause folding) influencing the stratospheric transport.* <br />
