## 12/13/2024
I will chair two sessions and give two poster presentations at AGU24:<br />
Session 1: Stratospheric Dynamics, Aerosol Processes, and Interactions with the Troposphere.<br />
Session 2: Boundary Layer Clouds and Climate Change.<br />
Poster 1: Lagrangian Analysis of Particle Transport in the Stratosphere: How QBO Modulates Stratosphere-to-Troposphere Flux (ST-flux)?<br />
Poster 2: Using Large Eddy Simulations to Study How Climate Change Influences Aerosol-Cloud Interactions in Marine Boundary Layer.<br />

Thanks to the courtesy travel support from the US [CLIVAR](https://usclivar.org/), I will be attending the [Micro2Macro Workshop](https://usclivar.org/meetings/micro2macro) at the University of Wyoming in Laramie from October 28-30. I will present my research on aerosol-cloud interactions. <br />

I have received a non-compensated faculty position (as an incoming assistant professor) from the [University of Hawaii](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/atmo/index.php/2023/10/31/oceanography-atmospheric-sciences-more-highly-ranked-for-program-excellence/). From now on, feel free to contact me at: *hongwei8@hawaii.edu*. <br />

This summer, I joined the CICOES undergraduate intern program at the University of Washington as a research mentor. Click [here](https://cicoes.uw.edu/internships/interns/liam-schiffer/) to see my student's research results. <br />
**Project:** Using Data-Driven Methods to Estimate Cloud Radiative Effects. <br />
**Student:** Liam Schafer, an undergraduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. <br />

## 07/22/2024: <br />
I will give an online talk at [2024 APARC Reanalysis Intercomparison (A-RIP) Planning Workshop.](https://s-rip.github.io/events/meeting2024/) <br />
**Title:** *Quantifying Stratospheric Particle Transport and Exploring Related Physical Drivers: A Lagrangian Analysis.* <br />

Check our [new paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00664-8) in npj climate and atmospheric science! The paper is about stratospheric transport and dynamics, where we: <br />
**(1)** *Quantify the particle transport (e.g., particle number, lifetime, flux, tropospheric sinks) in the stratosphere.* <br />
**(2)** *Explore the physical drivers (e.g., QBO, tropopause folding) influencing the stratospheric transport.* <br />
