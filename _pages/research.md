I am focusing on developing and applying different types of models to study multiscale atmospheric processes and climate science. My main research interests include:  <br />

1. Large-scale stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosol processes.  <br />
2. Smalle-scale aerosol-cloud interactions in the marine boundary layer.  <br />
3. Their (1 and 2) applications in climate intervention (geoengineering). <br />



Developing a coupled multiscale model.
------

I created a Lagrangian plume model and coupled the new Lagrangian plume model into a global model to build a multiscale plume-in-grid (PiG) model ([Sun et al., 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002816)). This coupled PiG model is able to resolve subgrid plumes (e.g., aircraft plumes), which cannot be resolved by conventional global models. <br />

Stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosol processes.
------

To understand how the background circulation (e.g., BDC, QBO, tropopause folding) influences particle transport in the stratosphere, I use a Lagrangian trajectory model (driven by ERA5 data) to simulate particle transport in the stratosphere based on a stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) strategy (All particles have initial locations at tropical lower stratosphere) under present-day conditions. Based on the simulating results, I: <br />
(1) Quantify particles’ number, flux, lifetime, and tropospheric sinks in different stratospheric regions (i.e., tropical, mid-lat, polar regions), as shown in Figure 2. ([Sun et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00664-8)). <br />
(2) Evaluate particles’ tropospheric sinks that are co-located with tropopause folding mainly beneath the mid-lat jet stream. <br />
(3) Explore the mechanisms of how QBO modulates the stratosphere-to-troposphere particle flux (ST-flux) crossing the tropopause, as shown in Figure 3. <br />
(4) Find a zonal asymmetry of poleward transport for particles in the tropical lower stratosphere ([Sun et al., 2023](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL105371)). <br />
