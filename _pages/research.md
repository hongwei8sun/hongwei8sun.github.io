I am focusing on developing and applying different types of models to study multiscale processes in the atmosphere. My main research interests include: (1) large-scale stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosol processes, (2) smaller-scale aerosol-cloud interactions in marine boundary layer, and (3) their applications in climate intervention (geoengineering). <br />

1 Multiscale model development.
------

I created a Lagrangian plume model and coupled the new Lagrangian plume model into a global model to build a multiscale plume-in-grid (PiG) model ([Sun et al., 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002816)). This coupled PiG model is able to resolve subgrid plumes (e.g., aircraft plumes), which cannot be resolved by conventional global models. <br />
