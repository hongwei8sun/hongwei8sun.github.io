Postdoctoral Scholar Opportunity in Aerosol Dynamics Modeling at the University of Chicago
---
Wang Aerosol Lab (PI: Mingyi Wang) at the University of Chicago invites applications for a postdoctoral scholar to lead innovative research on aerosol dynamics in dense aircraft plumes, providing the foundation for assessing the efficacy and environmental risks of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). <br />
The postdoc will be co-mentored by Prof. Mingyi Wang (UChicago), Prof. Jeff Pierce (CSU), and Prof. Hongwei Sun (UHawaii), fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across atmospheric chemistry, fluid dynamics, and climate modeling. <br />
While the start date can be flexible, the position will be available from March 31, 2025, and will remain open until filled. To apply, please email Prof. Mingyi Wang (mingyiw@uchicago.edu). <br />
More details can be found [here](https://hongwei8sun.github.io/files/Postdoc_WangLab_UChicago_Modeling_2025.pdf). <br />
