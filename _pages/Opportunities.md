PhD Positions in Stratosphere and Aerosol-Cloud Interactions at the University of Hawaii at Manoa
------

Dr. Hongwei Sun is seeking 1-2 PhD students to join his new research group in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Our research focuses on developing and applying various of modeling methods to study multiscale atmospheric processes, including (1) large-scale stratospheric dynamics and aerosols and (2) small-scale aerosol-cloud interactions. Students can also study applications of (1) and (2) in climate engineering (or geoengineering) if interested. Perspective students are encouraged to email Dr. Hongwei Sun at hongwei8@hawaii.edu to express their interest prior to applying. <br />

Required qualifications for PhD candidates:
------

1. A BS or MS degree in Atmospheric Sciences, Environmental Science, Meteorology, Climatology, Physics, Math, Computer Science, or a related field. <br />
2. Strong self-motivation and enthusiasm for atmospheric sciences. <br />

Preferred qualifications:
------

1. Research experience in atmospheric sciences. <br />
2. Proficiency in programming languages (e.g., Fortran, Matlab, Python, R, or NCL). <br />
3. Excellent written and oral communication skills. <br />
*Please note that while the preferred qualifications are beneficial, Dr. Sun is committed to helping students develop these skills throughout their graduate studies, provided they are self-motivated and enthusiastic. <br />

Application instructions:
------

The PhD application process consists of two parts: <br />
Part 1: Submission to University of Hawaii Graduate Division. <br />
Part 2: Submission of Materials to the Dept. of Atmospheric Sciences. <br />
