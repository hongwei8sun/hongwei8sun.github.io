Postdoctoral Scholar Opportunity in Aerosol Dynamics Modeling at the University of Chicago
-
Wang Aerosol Lab (PI: Mingyi Wang) at the University of Chicago invites applications for a postdoctoral scholar to lead innovative research on aerosol dynamics in dense aircraft plumes, providing the foundation for assessing the efficacy and environmental risks of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). <br />
The postdoc will be co-mentored by Prof. Mingyi Wang (UChicago), Prof. Jeff Pierce (CSU), and Prof. Hongwei Sun (UHawaii), fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across atmospheric chemistry, fluid dynamics, and climate modeling. <br />
While the start date can be flexible, the position will be available from March 31, 2025, and will remain open until filled. To apply, please email Prof. Mingyi Wang (mingyiw@uchicago.edu). <br />

Funded PhD Positions in Multiscale Modeling of Stratosphere and Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (expired in Dec 2025)
---
Dr. Hongwei Sun is seeking 1-2 PhD students (starting Fall 2025) to join his research group in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. <br />
Sun Group focuses on developing and applying various modeling methods to study multiscale atmospheric processes, including (1) large-scale stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosols and (2) small-scale aerosol-cloud interactions. Students can also study applications of (1) and (2) in climate engineering (or geoengineering) if interested. <br />
Students are encouraged to email Dr. Hongwei Sun at hongwei8@hawaii.edu to express their interest (with their CV and transcript) before applying. <br />
More details can be found [here](https://hongwei8sun.github.io/files/Funded%20PhD%20Positions%20in%20Multiscale%20Modeling%20of%20Stratosphere%20and%20Aerosol.pdf). <br />
