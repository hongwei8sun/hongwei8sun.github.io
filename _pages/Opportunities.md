Funded PhD Positions in Multiscale Modeling of Stratosphere and Aerosol-Cloud Interactions
--

Dr. Hongwei Sun is seeking 1-2 PhD students (starting Fall 2025 or later) to join his [research group](https://hongwei8sun.github.io/) in the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/atmo/index.php/2023/10/31/oceanography-atmospheric-sciences-more-highly-ranked-for-program-excellence/) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Sun Group focuses on developing and applying various modeling methods to study multiscale atmospheric processes, including (1) large-scale stratospheric transport, dynamics, and aerosols and (2) small-scale aerosol-cloud interactions. Students can also study applications of (1) and (2) in climate engineering (or geoengineering) if interested. Students are encouraged to email Dr. Hongwei Sun at *hongwei8@hawaii.edu* to express their interest (with their CV and transcript) before applying. <br />

**Required Qualifications:** <br />
(1) A BS or MS degree in Atmospheric Science, Environmental Science, Physics, Math, Computer Science, or a related field. <br />
(2) Strong self-motivation and enthusiasm for atmospheric sciences. <br />

**Preferred Qualifications:** <br />
(1) Research experience in atmospheric sciences. <br />
(2) Proficiency in programming languages (e.g., Fortran, Python, Matlab, R). <br />
(3) Good written and oral communication skills. <br />
**Please note that while the above qualifications are preferred, Dr. Sun is committed to helping students develop/enhance these skills throughout their graduate studies, provided they are self-motivated and enthusiastic.* <br />

**Application Instructions:** <br />
The PhD application process consists of two parts: <br />
Part 1: Submission to the University of Hawaii Graduate Division. <br />
Part 2: Submission of Materials to the Dept. of Atmospheric Sciences. <br />
