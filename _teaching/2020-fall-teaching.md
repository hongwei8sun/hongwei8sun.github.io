Description: Physical concepts necessary to understand atmospheric structure and motion. Phenomena studied include the formation of clouds and precipitation, solar and terrestrial radiation, dynamical balance of the large-scale wind, and the origin of cyclones. Concepts developed for understanding todayâ€™s atmosphere are applied to understanding the record of past climate change and the prospects for climate change in the future.
