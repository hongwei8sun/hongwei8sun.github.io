Teaching as an International Scholar: A Lunch Discussion for International TFs

Description: are you a TF who got your undergraduate degree at an institution outside the U.S.? If so, you may have questions about teaching undergraduates at Harvard. How might the undergraduate experience here differ from your own experience? As an International TF, what do you need to know to navigate teaching at Harvard? In this interactive panel discussion, you will have the opportunity to explore issues related to teaching across borders and boundaries and hear from Harvard undergraduate students and experienced international TFs. Undergraduate students will share their perspectives on what strategies effective TFs use, and experienced TFs will discuss what they found useful when they started teaching at Harvard. Both groups will discuss how building connections and rapport will help you be a more effective communicator and teacher.
